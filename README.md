# Ometv auto-skipping based on gender 

A code snippet for auto-skipping.

## How to use 

In developer tool, paste the code to sources/snippet and run.

## How does it work?

It uses face-api.js to determine gender in realtime and clicks the `Next` button if all faces are male.

## Credits

I adapt the code from a [demo](https://github.com/vladmandic/face-api/blob/master/demo/webcam.js).

You can check the [demo online](https://vladmandic.github.io/face-api/demo/webcam.html).
